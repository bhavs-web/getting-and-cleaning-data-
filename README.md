# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA #

## Steps to do the project ##
* Download the data set  and unzip data. 
* Read data from read.table()
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one organised and combined data set.
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Correctly label the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* Write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.
